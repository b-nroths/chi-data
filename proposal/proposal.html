<ul>
<li>Why do some parts of a city grow faster than others?</li>
<li>Are certain parts of the city “cut-off” from economic development?</li>
<li>What will determine if parts of a city are connected?</li>
<li>How do jobs &amp; money flow from one part of a city to another?</li>
<li>Can we predict what neighborhoods will take off or fall behind?</li>
<li>Are economic development incentives worth it?  Do they deliver on the results they promise?  For example, job training centers, small business grants, etc.</li>
<li>Can the connectedness of employee-employer blocks also be used to predict other datapoints such as the health or longevity of a neighborhood?</li>

<h4 id="power-and-centrality-a-family-of-measures">Power and Centrality: A Family of Measures</h4>
<p>This paper looks at hos centrality that in bargaining situations it is advantageous to be connected to those who have few options because power comes from being connected to those who are powerless.  Being connected to powerful others who have many potential trading partners reduces one&#39;s bargaining power.  The author&#39;s develop a model for centrality c(alpha, beta) where beta reflects teh degree to which an individual&#39;s status is a function of the satuses of those whom he or she is connected model to </p>

<p>Power does not equal centrality in exchange networks.  In a set of experimental and simulatiln studies, they showed those who were the most central were not the most successful in exercising baragaining power..  Others have thought that centrality is equivalent to power</p>

Suggests that a country’s productive structure may limit its range of income inequality.  Can a method like this be applied to neighborhoods within a city?</p>

<h3 id="datasets">Datasets</h3>
<h4 id="longitudinal-employer-household-dynamics">Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics</h4>
<p>This is dataset is generated by the US Census bureau and provides detailed Employee-Employer relationships at the block level.  The census bureau creates this dataset by using data that states supply on quarterly worker wage and employment records (QCEW) and merging it with their Master Address File and Business Registrar File. The dataset has been produced quarterly from 2005 to 2014.  A summary of each table is provided below.<br>Data Acquisition phase: so far I have downloaded the data</p>

<h4 id="open-street-map-transportation-routes-">Open Street Map Transportation Routes.</h4>
<p>OSM is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world.  The OSM project began in 2004 and aggregates user generated and government map related data. In my analysis, I plan to use road and transportation related data such as bus and subway routes to build a map of how different blocks relate to each other.  One drawback of the data source is that you can’t see how data has changed over time (ie if a road was added or a bus route was added).<br>Data acquisition phase: I have downloaded the data and made a few maps (using the OSMNX package from Geoff Boeing)</p>
<h4 id="city-of-chicago-open-data-portal-and-plenario">City of Chicago Open Data Portal and Plenario</h4>
<p>The City of Chicago publically releases many datasets.  Data I have from my previous work is below<br><img src="img/img4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In addition, I have recently added the following datasets which provide more business data:</p>
<h5 id="building-permits-2006-present-">Building Permits (2006-present)</h5>
<p>Permits issued by the Department of Buildings in the City of Chicago from 2006 to the present.<br><a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Buildings/Building-Permits/ydr8-5enu">https://data.cityofchicago.org/Buildings/Building-Permits/ydr8-5enu</a></p>

<p>Data acquisition phase: I have all the data being downloaded into database daily.  Time spans on each dataset vary slightly</p>
<h3 id="data-visualization-and-web-interface">Data Visualization and Web Interface</h3>
<p>As part of the project I will build some interactive visualizations published on the web.  Part of this data platform will include a way to continually refresh and publish more recent data and query across published datasets.  This code will be open sourced and feature extraction will be very transparent.</p>
<p>Some tech I will use include:</p>
