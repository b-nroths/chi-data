## M.A. Thesis Proposal

### Research Questions
- Why do some parts of a city grow faster than others?
- Are certain parts of the city “cut-off” from economic development?
- What will determine if parts of a city are connected?
- Are economic development incentives worth it?  Do they deliver on the results they promise?  For example, job training centers, small business grants, etc.

### Datasets
#### Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics
This is dataset is generated by the US Census bureau and provides detailed Employee-Employer relationships at the block level.  The census bureau creates this dataset by using data that states supply on quarterly worker wage and employment records (QCEW) and merging it with their Master Address File and Business Registrar File. The dataset has been produced quarterly from 2005 to 2014.  A summary of each table is provided below.
Data Acquisition phase: so far I have downloaded the data

##### Workplace Area Characteristics

##### Residential Level Characteristics

#### Open Street Map Transportation Routes.  
OSM is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world.  The OSM project began in 2004 and aggregates user generated and government map related data. In my analysis, I plan to use road and transportation related data such as bus and subway routes to build a map of how different blocks relate to each other.  One drawback of the data source is that you can’t see how data has changed over time (ie if a road was added or a bus route was added).
Data acquisition phase: I have downloaded the data and made a few maps (using the OSMNX package from Geoff Boeing)

#### City of Chicago Open Data Portal and Plenario
The City of Chicago publically releases many datasets.  Data I have from my previous work is below

In addition, I have recently added the following datasets which provide more business data:

##### Building Permits (2006-present)
Permits issued by the Department of Buildings in the City of Chicago from 2006 to the present.

##### Small Business Improvement Funds (2001 – 2012)
Funds used to help owners of commercial and industrial properties within specific TIF districts to repair or remodel their facilities for their own business or on behalf of tenants.

Data acquisition phase: I have all the data being downloaded into database daily.  Time spans on each dataset vary slightly
