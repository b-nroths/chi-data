## M.A. Thesis Proposal

### Research Questions
- Why do some parts of a city grow faster than others?
- Are certain parts of the city “cut-off” from economic development?
- What will determine if parts of a city are connected?
- How do jobs & money flow from one part of a city to another?
- Are economic development incentives worth it?  Do they deliver on the results they promise?  For example, job training centers, small business grants, etc.
- Can the connectedness of employee-employer blocks also be used to predict other datapoints such as the health or longevity of a neighborhood. 


### Theory & Papers
- https://atlas.media.mit.edu/static/pdf/LinkingEconomicComplexityInstitutionsAndIncomeInequality.pdf
Economic complexity captures information about an economy’s level of development that is relevant to the ways an economy generates and distributes its income. Suggests that a country’s productive structure may limit its range of income inequality.  Can a method like this be applied to neighborhoods within a city?

Interesting question:
Where is infrastructure investment best targeted to stimulate private sector investment and third sector action? We will create a new diagnostic tool based on analysis of residuals between different kinds of infrastructure capacity and configuration, and economic activity.

One prominent research area within this nexus has examined whether urban structural characteristics, such as the balance of jobs and housing, impacts broader transportation patterns, particularly commuting outcomes.

### Datasets
#### Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics
This is dataset is generated by the US Census bureau and provides detailed Employee-Employer relationships at the block level.  The census bureau creates this dataset by using data that states supply on quarterly worker wage and employment records (QCEW) and merging it with their Master Address File and Business Registrar File. The dataset has been produced quarterly from 2005 to 2014.  A summary of each table is provided below.
Data Acquisition phase: so far I have downloaded the data

##### Origin-Destination

##### Workplace Area Characteristics

##### Residential Level Characteristics

#### Open Street Map Transportation Routes.  
OSM is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world.  The OSM project began in 2004 and aggregates user generated and government map related data. In my analysis, I plan to use road and transportation related data such as bus and subway routes to build a map of how different blocks relate to each other.  One drawback of the data source is that you can’t see how data has changed over time (ie if a road was added or a bus route was added).
Data acquisition phase: I have downloaded the data and made a few maps (using the OSMNX package from Geoff Boeing)

#### City of Chicago Open Data Portal and Plenario
The City of Chicago publically releases many datasets.  Data I have from my previous work is below

In addition, I have recently added the following datasets which provide more business data:

##### Building Permits (2006-present)
Permits issued by the Department of Buildings in the City of Chicago from 2006 to the present.

##### Small Business Improvement Funds (2001 – 2012)
Funds used to help owners of commercial and industrial properties within specific TIF districts to repair or remodel their facilities for their own business or on behalf of tenants.

Data acquisition phase: I have all the data being downloaded into database daily.  Time spans on each dataset vary slightly

### Data Visualization and Web Interface
As part of the project I will build some interactive visualizations published on the web.  Part of this data platform will include a way to continually refresh and publish more recent data and query across published datasets.  This code will be open sourced and feature extraction will be very transparent.

Some tech I will use include:
